# Smart_Blind_Stick
An Arduino-based smart blind stick using sensors for person, obstacle, fall, and water detection.

A fully functional Arduino-based blind stick that enhances mobility and safety with real-time detection of people, obstacles, water, and falls, using a combination of sensors and modular feedback systems (buzzer, LED, vibration motor). Activated with a touch, this stick senses danger—buzzes, vibrates, and lights up. Whether it's a puddle, a wall, or a fall, it's got your back.

**Key Features**
Ultrasonic Sensor — Measures distance to obstacles (<1 meter)
PIR Sensor — Detects human motion nearby
Water Sensor — Detects puddles and wet surfaces
Accelerometer — Detects sudden falls or shocks
Touch Activation — Touch to boot/reset system
Adaptive Buzzer Alerts — Custom sound patterns for different threats
Visual LED Feedback
Perception-Based System — Combines multiple sensor inputs for intelligent environmental feedback
